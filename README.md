#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Purpose
This repository contains the code to summarize the data from a study where data was collected from the accelerometers on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

The resulting tidy dataset consists of one record for each combination
of subject and activity with the average measurment from a variety of 
calculations collected as part of the original analysis

### Data Set used for this Analysis:

[UCI HAR Dataset][id]  
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Steps to create tidy dataset from script:
1. Download Dataset from link above
2. Unzip contents of dataset into working directory
* Make sure the folder inside the working directory is labled: "UCI HAR Dataset"
4. Execute run_analysis.R to create the tidy data set in your working
directory
