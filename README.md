#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Purpose
This repository contains the code to summarize the data from a study where data was collected 
from the accelerometers on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

The resulting tidy dataset consists of one record for each combination
of subject and activity with the average calculation from a variety of 
measurments collected as part of the original analysis

### Data Set used for this Analysis:

[id]: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
UCI HAR Dataset

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Steps to create tidy dataset from script:
1. Download Dataset from link above
2. Unzip contents of dataset into working directory
  * Make sure the folder inside the working directory is labled: "UCI HAR Dataset"
4. Execute run_analysis.R to create the a summarized data set named tidy_data.csv 
  * Note: this repository already contains the output from the anlysis in the file tidy_data.csv. 
  * If you check this repository out in full to your working directory, runing script again will overwrite this file with a new file containing the results of the run_analysis.R script
