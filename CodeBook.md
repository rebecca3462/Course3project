### Original Dataset Properties
This data was from a study performed on 30 indivduals wearing a Samsung Galaxy Smartphone with an accelerometer and gyroscope. Measurements were taken from the devices as the 30 Subjects performed 6 different activities. Various statistical calculations were performed on these measurements and recorded for each subject and activity.

For complete information on the original study follow link below:

#### Components of Original Dataset
* The 30 Subjects were broken into two groups: 70% Test and 30% Train
* The data existed in two folders, one with data from test group and the other with data from the train group
* Each set contained 3 files
    * X\_ Values which were the measurements spread across 561 Columns
    * y\_ The row position of the 6 activites
    * subject\_ The rows positions of the 30 subjects
* The names of the measurements were in a file entitled features.txt in the root directory
* the names of the activities were in a file entitled activity\_labels.txt in the root directory

     
#### Tidy Data Set Properties

**Each Record Represents:**

* A combination of Subject and Activity with the mean of the statistics on the measurements for each combination

**Properties**

* Each subject has 6 records, one for each activity

* The subjects actually performed the activities more than once in the orignal study so these measurements represent the mean of the orignal statistics
